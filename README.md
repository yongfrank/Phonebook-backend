# [Part 3][part-3] For Full Stack Open

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

* a Node.js and Express
* b Deploying app to internet
* c Saving data to MongoDB
* d Validation and ESLint
